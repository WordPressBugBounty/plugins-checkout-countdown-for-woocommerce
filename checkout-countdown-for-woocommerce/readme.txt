### Configuring Ideal Countdown Duration
Choosing the right duration for your checkout countdown timer can have a significant impact on your store's performance. You should strike a balance between creating urgency without pressuring the customer. Too short a duration may annoy customers and lead to abandoned carts, while too long a duration may fail to instill a sense of urgency. We recommend analyzing your average customer's time spent on your store and experimenting with different timer durations to find the sweet spot that optimizes conversions and overall customer experience.

### Expiry Message Customization Tips
The expiry message displayed when the countdown timer reaches zero is crucial for effectively managing customer expectations and maintaining a positive relationship with them. Customize the message to ensure clear communication, politeness, and assurance that the customer can still purchase the product even after the timer expires. Offering assistance, suggesting alternative products, or presenting the option to restart the countdown can help retain customers and prevent them from leaving your site disappointed. Testing different expiry messages and monitoring their impact on customer behavior will help you find the most effective approach for your store.

###  Selling limited stock? Try reserving stock in customer carts.
